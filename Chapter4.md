# Chapter 4 Practice Exercises

4.1 Provide two programming examples in which multithreading provides
better performance than a single-threaded solution.

  **Answer:**

  - `In a web server environment, a number of users request for the application. Thus, when any application is executed through the web server, a number of different threads are executed for different users.`

  - `In graphic user interface, different threads are executed for different tasks. For example, first thread is used to fix the bugs, the second thread is responsible for the execution of the program and another one is responsible for the performance of the program.`

  - `If any program is executed using only one thread, then, if that thread is blocked, the total application will stop responding. So, it can be said that the performance of multi-threading is much better than system with single thread.`

4.2 What are two differences between user-level threads and kernel-level
threads? Under what circumstances is one type better than the other?

**Answer:**

- The following are the differences between user-level threads and kernel level threads:

**Answer:**

| User-level threads | Kernel-level threads |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| The existence of user- level threads is unknown to the kernel. | The existence of the kernel-level threads is known to the kernel.
| User-level threads are managed without kernel support. | Kernel-level threads are managed by the operating system. |
| user-level threads are faster to create than are kernel-level threads. | Kernel-level threads are user-level threads. |
| User-level threads are scheduled by the thread library. | Kernel-level threads are scheduled by the kernel. |

**Answer:**

Circumstances where kernel-level threads are better than user-level threads:

- `If the kernel is single-threaded, then kernel-level threads are better than user-level threads, because any user-level thread performing a blocking system call will cause the entire process to block, even if other threads are available to run within the application.`

- `For example a process P1 has 2 kernel level threads and process P2 has 2 user-level threads. If one thread in P1 gets blocked, its second thread is not affected. But in case of P2 if one thread is blocked (say for I/O), the whole process P2 along with the 2nd thread gets blocked.`

- `In a multiprocessor environment, the kernel-level threads are better than user-level threads, because kernel-level threads can run on different processors simultaneously while user-level threads of a process will run on one processor only even if multiple processors are available.`

Circumstances where user-level threads are better than kernel-level threads:

- `If the kernel is time shared, then user-level threads are better than kernel-level threads, because in time shared systems context switching takes place frequently. Context switching between kernel level threads has high overhead, almost the same as a process whereas context switching between user-level threads has almost no overhead as compared to kernel level threads.`


4.3 Describe the actions taken by a kernel to context-switch between kernellevel
threads.

  **Answer:**

  - `Kernel is the head of any operating system. A number of threads with different tasks are executed by the kernel. The interrupts generated by multi-threading are handled by the kernel.`

  - `When a context switch is occurred among the threads of kernel level, the kernel suspends all the threads and their respective values from the registers of the central processing unit (CPU). The newly scheduled threads restore the values in the registers.`

  - `For a kernel, the execution time is the main issue. If the new processes are created for the execution, rather than threads, it becomes more time consuming. So, the context stored in the registers of the CPU is switched.`


4.4 What resources are used when a thread is created? How do they differ
from those used when a process is created?

  **Answer:**

  - `A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization, also known as light weight process. So, creating either a user or kernel thread involves allocating a small data structure to hold a thread ID, a program counter, a register set, stack and priority, whereas creating a process involves allocating the large data structure called as PCB(Process Control Block) which includes a memory map, list of open files, and environment variables. Allocating and managing the memory map is typically the most time-consuming activity.`

  Resources are used when a thread is created:

  1. `Code section`

  2. `Data section`

  3. `Other operation system resources such as open files and signals with other threads belonging to the same process whereas each and every process has separate code section, data section and operating system resources.`

4.5 Assume that an operating system maps user-level threads to the kernel
using the many-to-many model and that the mapping is done through
LWPs. Furthermore, the system allows developers to create real-time
threads for use in real-time systems. Is it necessary to bind a real-time
thread to an LWP? Explain.

  **Answer:**

  - `In an application which is based on real time processing, time plays an important role for execution. Threads are the parts of the process and also known as light weight process (LWP).`

  - `When a thread is noticeable as the thread of real time but a Light weight process is not bounded with this thread, then, the thread must have to be waiting for the attachment of LWP.`

  - `When a LWP is attached to any thread, the priority of that thread becomes higher. So, in a condition of a dead lock, if a thread is having LWP, the thread has minimum waiting time for the execution and time is saved. Thus, it can be said the LWP attached thread is required in the real time systems.`

4.6 Provide two programming examples in which multithreading does not
provide better performance than a single-threaded solution.

**Answer:**

  1. `Any sequential program is to be single threaded. For example, a program that calculates the gross salary, net salary, and tax of an employee gives better performance when it is single threaded.`

  2. `Shell program such as the C-shell or Korn shell is to be single threaded as such programs require close monitoring of its workspace. While executing the program, the files that are environment variables etc. are to be closely observed.`

4.7 Under what circumstances does a multithreaded solution using multiple
kernel threads provide better performance than a single-threaded
solution on a single-processor system?

**Answer:**

1. `A web service that services each request in a separate thread.`

2. `A parallelized application such as matrix multiplication where different parts of the matrix may be worked on in parallel.`

3. `An interactive GUI program such as a debugger where a thread is used to monitor user input, another thread represents the running application, and a third thread monitors performance.`

4.8
Which of the following components of program state are shared across
threads in a multithreaded process?

a. Register values

b. Heap memory

c. Global variables

d. Stack memory

**Answer:**

  - `Heap memory and Global variables shared across in multi-thread process. In multi-thread process, each thread has its own stack and register values.`

4.9 Can a multithreaded solution using multiple user-level threads achieve
better performance on a multiprocessor system than on a singleprocessor
system? Explain.

**Answer:**

- `A multithreaded system comprising of multiple user-level threads cannot make use of the different processors in a multiprocessor system simultaneously. The operating system sees only a single process and will not schedule the different threads of the process on separate processors. Consequently, there is no performance benefit associated with executing multiple user-level threads on a multiprocessor system.`

4.10 In Chapter 3, we discussed Googleâ€™s Chrome browser and its practice
of opening each new website in a separate process. Would the same
benefits have been achieved if instead Chrome had been designed to
open each new website in a separate thread? Explain.

- `Processes and threads both can typically be defined as sequences of execution, for any program. The main difference lies beneath the memory space they share on the RAM or main memory of the system while getting executed.`

  - `Each process acquires a unique address space on the memory; whereas threads of a program usually share the same memory space for their execution.`

  - `Processes act independently while threads always remain dependent on their consequent thread for their execution. Threads remain a chain of instructions where a small breakdown may terminate the entire execution.`

  - `Google Chrome browser maintains to open each new website as an independent process rather than opening them as threads to ensure that no website breakdown affects others' service.`

  - `One cannot maintain the efficiency of the browser while opening each new website as a thread, because threads are allocated with shared memory spaces. Hence they may affect each other if one of them crashes unexpectedly.`

4.11 Is it possible to have concurrency but not parallelism? Explain.

  **Answer:**

  - `Both are a form of an operating system. Sometimes, to complete a task, both methods needed to finish the task and sometimes one. The priority to select, which form is better, depends upon the requirement of system and according to that operating system coding created.`

  `Yes, it is possible to have concurrency but not parallelism.`

  Concurrency:

  `Concurrency means where two different tasks or threads start working together in an overlapped time period, however, it does not mean they run at same instant.`

  Example:

  `Multi-task switch on a single-cored processor`

  `In a Concurrency, minimum two threads are to be executed for processing.`

  `A more generalized form of parallelism includes time-slicing which is a form of virtual parallelism.`

  Explanation:

  `Consider a scenario where Process 'A' and 'B' have four different task P1, P2, P3, and P4. So in order to go for execution, first Process 'A' of P1 executes, then Process 'B' of P1 executes, Secondly, Process 'A' of P2 executes, then Process 'B' of P2 executes and goes on until all the threads are finished for their execution.`

  Parallelism:

  `Parallelism is where two or more different tasks start their execution at the same time. It means that the two tasks or threads start working simultaneously.`

  Example:

  `Multi-cored Processor`

  Explanation:

  `Consider a Scenario, where Process 'A' and 'B' and each have four different tasks P1, P2, P3, and P4, so both process go for simultaneous execution and each works independently.`

  `Therefore, concurrency can be occurring number of times which are same as parallelism if the process switching is quick and rapid. So, yes, it is possible to have concurrency but not parallelism.`

4.12 Using Amdahlâ€™s Law, calculate the speedup gain of an application that
has a 60 percent parallel component for

(a) two processing cores and

(b) four processing cores.

  **Answer:**
  `As per Amdahl's law formula for the speedup gain of an application is speedup <= 1/(S + (1 - S)/N) where, S is the portion of the application that must be performed serially and N is the no. of processing cores.`

  (a)
  `For two processing cores and 60 percent parallel component, S is 40 percent that is 0.4 and N is 2.`

  `speedup <= 1/(0.4 + (1-0.4)/2`
  `speedup <= 1.428`
  `Speedup gain is 1.428 times.`

  (b)
  `For four processing cores and 60 percent parallel component Here, S is 40 percent that is 0.4 and N is 4`

  `speedup <= 1/(0.4 + (1-0.4)/4)`
  `speedup <= 1.81`
  `Speedup gain is 1.81 times.`

  4.13

  Determine if the following problems exhibit task or data parallelism:

  The multithreaded statistical program described in Exercise 4.21

  The multithreaded Sudoku validator described in Project 1 in this
chapter

  The multithreaded sorting program described in Project 2 in this
chapter

 The multithreaded web server described in Section 4.1

  **Answer:**

  - `The statistical program is Data Parallelism. Here, multiple threads are created and each thread is performing functions like calculating average, finding minimum value, finding maximum value on same data.`

  - `So in order to perform these operations it creates threads and does the operation in parallel for task completion.`


  - `The multithreaded Sudoku validator is Task Parallelism. Here, in Sudoku solution example, there are constraints that each row or column should contain the digits from 1 to 9. And each grid should have digits from 1 to 9, which can go when one thread completes, it starts another until all eleven threads.`


  `So here it takes task from one thread to another, until it completes and satisfies all tasks and these tasks need not to run concurrently.`


  - `The multithreaded sorting program is Data Parallelism. Here, in sorting list, the list is divided in two half threads runs concurrently and execute individually to provide resultant threads and then`


  - `The multithreaded web server is Task Parallelism. In single threaded, the threads which are created are able to perform only one task, whereas, multithreaded creates threads in such a way that is able to perform multitask at a time leading to better performance.`

 4.14 A system with two dual-core processors has four processors available
for scheduling. A CPU-intensive application is running on this system.
All input is performed at program start-up, when a single file must
be opened. Similarly, all output is performed just before the program terminates, when the program results must be written to a single
file. Between startup and termination, the program is entirely CPUbound.
Your task is to improve the performance of this application
by multithreading it. The application runs on a system that uses the
one-to-one threading model (each user thread maps to a kernel thread).
â€¢ How many threads will you create to perform the input and output?
Explain.
â€¢ How many threads will you create for the CPU-intensive portion of
the application? Explain.


  **Answer:**

  - `Threads count depends upon the priority and requirements of the application. So only thread is enough for this kind of application and this thread is going to handle both input and output operation.`

    - `It is a concurrency approach. Here, it only makes sense to create as many threads as there are blocking system calls, as the threads will be spent blocking.`

    - `It doesn't provides any benefits to create an additional threads.`

    - `Thus, only a signal thread creation makes sense for input and a single thread for output.`

    - `Four threads are created to perform the CPU-intensive portion of the application. It is because, there should be as many threads as there are processing cores.`

    - `It would be the waste of processing resources to use fewer threads.`

    - `Also any number greater than four would be unable to run.`

4.15 Consider the following code segment:

pid t pid;

pid = fork();

if (pid == 0) { /* child process /*

fork();

thread create( . . .);

}fork();

a. How many unique processes are created?

b. How many unique threads are created?

  **Answer:**

  - `The statement pid = fork(); before the if statement creates one process. The parent process say p creates this process. Let it be p1.`

  - `The statement fork(); in the if statement creates one process. The parent process p creates this process. Let it be p2.`

  - `After the if statement, parent process p, process p1 and process p2 will execute fork(); creating three new processes.`

    - `One process is created by parent process p.`
    - `One process is created by process p1.`
    - `One process is created by process p2.`


  `Hence, 5 unique processes (p1, p2, p3, p4, p5) will be created. If the parent process is also considered, then 6 unique processes (p, p1, p2, p3, p4, p1, p5) will be created.`

  - `Thread creation is done in if block. Only child process p1 is executed in the if block. Therefore, process p1 will be created one thread.`

  - `In the if block one process p2 is created using fork(). Therefore, process p2 will also create a thread.`

  `Hence, 2 unique threads will be created.`

4.16 As described in Section 4.7.2, Linux does not distinguish between
processes and threads. Instead, Linux treats both in the same way,
allowing a task to be more akin to a process or a thread depending on the
set of flags passed to the clone() system call. However, other operating
systems, such as Windows, treat processes and threads differently.
Typically, such systems use a notation in which the data structure for
a process contains pointers to the separate threads belonging to the
process. Contrast these two approaches for modeling processes and
threads within the kernel.

  **Answer:**

  `Linux operating systems consider both threads and processes as tasks; it cannot distinguish between them. In contrast, windows operating system threads and processes differently.`

  `This approach has pros and cons while modeling threads and processes inside the kernel.`

  **Pros:**

   - `Linux consider this as similar, so codes belong to operating system can be cut down easily.`

   - `Scheduler present in the Linux operating systems do not need special code to test threads coupled with each processes.`

   - `It considers different threads and processes as a single task during the time of scheduling.`

  **Cons:**

    - `This ability makes it harder for the Linux operating system to inflict process-wide resource limitations directly.`

    - `Extra steps are needed to recognize the each processes belong to appropriate threads and complexity in performing relevant tasks.`


 4.17 The program shown in Figure 4.16 uses the Pthreads API. What would
be the output from the program at LINE C and LINE P?


include pthread.h

include stdio.h

include types.h

int value = 0;
void runner(void param);

int main(int argc, char argv[])

{

pid t pid;

pthread t tid;

pthread attr t attr;

pid = fork();

if (pid == 0) { /* child process /

pthread attr init(&attr);

pthread create(&tid,&attr,runner,NULL);

pthread join(tid,NULL);

printf("CHILD: value = %d",value); /* LINE C /

}else if (pid > 0) { parent process /

wait(NULL);

printf("PARENT: value = %d",value); /* LINE P /

  }
}
void runner(void param) {

value = 5;

pthread exit(0);

}

  **Answer:**


  `The output is CHILD: value = 5`

  - `The child process in the thread is forked by parent process and child process each have its own memory space.`

  - `After forking, the parent process waits for the completion of child process.`

  - `New thread is created for child process and the runner() function is called which set the value of the global vairlable to 5.`

  - `Thus, after execution of this line, the value displayed will be 5.`

  `The output of LINE P in the program:`

  `The output is PARENT: value = 0`

  - `After completing the child process, the value of the global variable present in parent process remains 0.`

  - `Thus, after execution of this line, the value displayed will be 0.`


4.18 Consider a multicore system and a multithreaded program written
using the many-to-many threading model. Let the number of user-level
threads in the program be greater than the number of processing cores
in the system. Discuss the performance implications of the following
scenarios.

a. The number of kernel threads allocated to the program is less than
the number of processing cores.

b. The number of kernel threads allocated to the program is equal to
the number of processing cores.

c. The number of kernel threads allocated to the program is greater
than the number of processing cores but less than the number of
user-level threads.

4.19 Pthreads provides an API for managing thread cancellation. The
pthread setcancelstate() function is used to set the cancellation
state. Its prototype appears as follows:
pthread setcancelstate(int state, int oldstate)
The two possible values for the state are PTHREAD CANCEL ENABLE and
PTHREAD CANCEL DISABLE.
Using the code segment shown in Figure 4.17, provide examples of
two operations that would be suitable to perform between the calls to
disable and enable thread cancellation

  **Answer:**

  - `Thread cancellation is a process of cancelling thread before its completion. Thread cancellation leads to termination of the executing thread in the process. To cancel a thread, below given functions are used.`

    - `In order to cancel thread, pthread_cancel() function is used.`

    - `pthread_cancel() functions depends on pthread_setcancelstate() function.`

    - `To cancel thread immediately PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS type is set.`

    - `The default cancellation type is PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERED which means thread is cancelled only when it reaches its termination point.`

`Thread cancellation state and type determine when the thread cancellation request is placed. There are two states in thread cancellation:`

 - `PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE in all cancellation state are held pending.`

 - `PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE in which cancellations requests are acted on according to thread cancellation types.`

 - `The default thread cancellation type is PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE.`

 - `The system test for pending cancellation requests in certain blocking functions, if cancellation function is ENABLED and its type is DEFERED. These points are known as cancellation points. pthread_testcancel() function is used to create cancellation points.`
